This is Library Management project which uses JAVA (GUI and Backend) and MYSQL (Database).

Scope and Objective of Project:-

  - The Library Management System allows the Librarian to login using a username and a password to access the system. 

  - The Librarian can perform many functions after logging into the system, such as, adding a new book, adding a new student, issuing a book, returning (accepting) a book, and view transactions (statistics about issuing and returning of books).

  - In the System, every book has an ISBN no., Name, Author, and a Price. 

  - Every student has a student ID, Name, Course, Branch, and Year.

  - While issuing a book the Librarian must enter the ISBN number of the book, the ID of the student, and the issue date. 

  - When the book is returned, student ID is entered by the Librarian to get details of the book issued, further the return date is mentioned and the book’s status is changed to returned/available.
